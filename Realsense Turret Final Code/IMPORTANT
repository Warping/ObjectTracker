All development is to be done on python 3.6.9 and nothing else. You need to install torch first, globally, with the file located in local_wheels, THEN somewhere else on your computer, install torchvision 0.9.1 with "git clone -b v0.9.1 https://github.com/pytorch/vision && cd vision && sudo python3.6 setup.py install". This is a massive pain and is in dire need of change.

yolov5 needs to also be installed and working with python 3.6.9. Probably also doesn't work well just like most things on the nano!

Download the correct version of torch off the nvidia website using the shell file or from https://nvidia.box.com/shared/static/p57jwntv436lfrd78inwl7iml6p13fzh.whl and rename it to torch-1.8.0-cp36-cp36m-linux_aarch64.whl.
